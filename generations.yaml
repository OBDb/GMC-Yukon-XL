  - name: "First Generation (as Suburban)"
    start_year: 1937
    end_year: 1999
    description: "Before becoming the Yukon XL in 2000, this vehicle was known as the GMC Suburban, sharing its platform and most components with the Chevrolet version. The Suburban established the concept of a full-size, station wagon-style body on a truck chassis, creating what would become the modern full-size SUV segment. Through multiple generations spanning over six decades, it evolved from a primarily commercial and fleet vehicle to a family-oriented people mover while maintaining its truck-based ruggedness and capability. The final generation as the Suburban (1992-1999) featured the GMT400 platform with V8 engines, available four-wheel drive, and substantial passenger and cargo capacity."

    description: "The current Yukon XL represents the most significant advancement in the model's history. Built on GM's T1XX platform, the most notable change is the adoption of an independent rear suspension, dramatically improving interior space (especially third-row comfort and cargo area) and ride quality. Engine options include 5.3L and 6.2L V8s, plus a 3.0L Duramax diesel inline-six. The interior is completely redesigned with a push-button electronic shifter, available 10.2-inch touchscreen, and significantly improved materials. The Denali trim received even greater differentiation with a unique interior design featuring genuine wood and hand-finished details. New to this generation is the AT4 trim with off-road focus, featuring standard four-wheel drive, all-terrain tires, and skid plates. Technology has advanced to include available features like power-sliding center console, rear pedestrian alert, and Super Cruise hands-free driving assistance. This generation maintains the traditional capabilities expected of a Yukon XL while offering unprecedented levels of refinement, technology, and luxury."
